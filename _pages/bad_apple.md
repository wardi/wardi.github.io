To test step 1 of the [homebrew cpu project](/cpu) we'll see
if we can play an actual video from the EEPROM to the LCD character
display module. Bad Apple is an ideal video for this purpose: it's
essentially monochrome and most of the video is recognizable even
at a very low resolution.

![Original Bad Apple](/images/original-apple.png)

The original Bad Apple video has 6569 frames at 30 fps for a running
time of 3m39s. We have 32768 bytes so we need to run
our clock at 150 Hz to fit the complete video in EEPROM.

This gives us about *5 bytes* of data per frame of video, or a
constant video bitrate of 1.2 kb/s.

## LCD display memory

The LCD character display module uses an HD44780 controller and
has 20 columns of characters and 4 rows of character cells.
Each character cell is a 5 x 8 grid of pixels with a single
pixel space in between.

The memory used to display characters is
split into two banks of 80 bytes interlaced so that lines 1 and 3
are bank 1 (D00-D39) and lines 2 and 4 are in bank 2 (E00-E39).

Bad Apple is in 4:3 aspect ratio which maps nicely to 40:32 pixels
given by taking the first 8 columns and 4 rows.

## Character ROM

The character ROM on the LCD display module includes a "space"
character with none of the pixels set and a solid block character
(`'\xff'`) with all pixels set. These can be used to quickly paint
the solid parts of the video area.

## CGRAM

Custom character patterns are made possible with CGRAM. This display
module has 8 CGRAM characters we can use (CG0-CG7), so up to 1/4 of
our 8 x 4 video area character cells can display a unique pattern at once.

The pixel patterns are given by the low 5 bits stored at each CGRAM address.
CGRAM is contiguous but we number the addresses based on the
character and row. E.g. C10 is the first row of CG1, and follows immediately
after C07.

## LCD commands

We interface with the LCD display module using 8 data pins (DB0-DB7)
and a register select (RS) pin.

When RS is low we can set the
display memory (DDRAM) or CGRAM address, clear the screen or issue
other cursor and display commands.
When RS is high we can write character data
to display memory (DDRAM) or send pixel data into CGRAM.

This code table can be expanded into a grid like the character ROM grid above:

We can see there are some unused values, like most of the function set
range and part of the set DDRAM address range. There are also some commands
with duplicate values like cursor or display shift commands and return home.

## Command compression

The EEPROM can only output 8 bits at a time but we need 9 bits including
RS to fully control the LCD display module.

If we add a 256-byte lookup table for RS then
we can combine sending character codes and LCD commands into 8 bits.
Also if we reassign the upper 4 bits (DB4-DB7) we can assign new positions
for commands in the table.

This is how the lookup table is wired to RS and the upper 4 bits (DB4-DB7):

In the table reassigning the upper 4 bits is the same as moving a command left or
right. This lets us fill in unused values or repeated commands, move the set
CGRAM address and function set commands out of the way, and replace unneeded
commands.

This is the combined lookup table that we use to map the 8 input bits from
the EEPROM to 9 output bits for the LCD display module:

This mapping allows issuing one command per clock cycle from our EEPROM to our
LCD display module including:

- addressing all CGRAM
- addressing most of display memory (all of the video area)
- output ASCII(ish) characters and the solid block character `'\xff'`
- output CGRAM characters (CG0-CG7)
- initialize the display with function set (`INI`)
- set the entry mode to "increment, no shifting" (`EIN`)
- clear the screen (`CLR`)
- hide the cursor (`HID`)

These are all we need to play our video and show text on the right
side of the display.

üëç Thank you for reading this far. In the next post we'll explore the
software that encodes video onto the 32K EEPROM using these commands.
