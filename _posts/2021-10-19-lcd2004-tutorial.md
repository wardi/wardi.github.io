Let's look at the LCD2004 LCD character display
module powered by an HD44780 we'll see how
to set the contrast and brightness then we'll
cover all the control pins, initialization,
writing to the display, cursor positioning,
reading from the display, creating custom
characters, and shifting left and right.

This is an inexpensive display module that's
quite easy to find.

I bought this for about ten dollars from an
Amazon seller.

It's typically shipped with an SPI adapter
like this one, and it's up to us to solder
this onto the module.

This is very useful if you're working with
a microcontroller but we're not going to be
using a microcontroller today so instead I've
soldered a row of header pins on so that this
display module can be plugged directly into
a breadboard for testing.

When buying an HD44780-powered display check
to see which character ROM it ships with.

Most of the characters in the first half will
be the same, these are mostly ASCII characters
but the second half of the characters can
be wildly different from one model to the
next.

Interestingly the HD44780 datasheet only mentions
using the controller with a one or a two line
display not a four line display like this
one, so we'll see what tricks this module
uses to display four lines.

Let's start by connecting the power.

VSS connects to zero volts.

VDD connects to 5 volts.

For v0 I'll connect a potentiometer that lets
me set the contrast.

There we have our test pattern.

For the backlight we use 5 volts to A and
0 volts to K.

This will give us the full brightness.

If we want to get a little bit fancier than
that we can connect a potentiometer here as
well.

Now i can set the brightness to any level
that i like.

The next few pins are ones that we can find
described on the datasheet.

First we're going to connect register select
which lets us choose between the
instruction register or the data register.

I'd like register select to be normally 5
volts, normally high.

So I'm going to connect through to high on
the other side of this button,
and when the button is pressed we'll go to
zero volts.

So that we can see what the state is we'll
add an LED.

next I'll connect the read/write pin and I'll
set it low for now.

In order to issue any command I need to use
the enable pin so I'll connect that one to
a button now.

This is one that i want normally low,
and I'll connect an LED to this as well.

I'm going to need some more room for the data
pins D0 through D7.

I'm just going to pop off the display module
and one thing to notice is that the ordering
of these is the reverse of what I would normally
have.

The D0 is the least significant bit so it'd
be nice to have that on the right side so
let's just reverse these.

I'll connect these lines to an LED array,
and let's use some dip switches to control
these values for input.

When the switch is closed these will be connected
to 5 volts,
and when the switches are open we'll pull
them down to zero volts.

Let's see if we've got this working.

Power on.

Our register select is showing high, when
I press it it goes low, that's perfect.

Our enable line is low, when i press it goes
high, great.

My dip switches all seem to be working.

The first command to issue is a function set
to set the interface display length and number
of lines so the display length will be set
to one, sorry, the data length will be set
to one, which means that we're going to be
using eight bit sequences instead of four
bit sequences and the display lines will be
set to one as well which means we have a two
line display instead of a one line display.
F will be ignored in our case for for a two
line display.

I'll need bits 11 1000 with register select
low and enable.

Okay the screen seems to be cleared.

Next I want to use the display control on
and off to enable the display and enable the
cursor.

With the cursor I have the option of having
an underline cursor or blinking or both, so
just to test it out I'll enable both of them.

This would be 1111,
with register select clear.

Here we go so I seem to have a garbage character
but I have my cursor there blinking.

Let's see if I can clear the display.

The clear display command is just a single 1,
register select low.

Okay I've just cleared the display and my
cursor is blinking.

Next I'm going to try to write some characters.

I like this little confused face on the bottom
line here.

In order to send this i need to send
0100 1111.

This time the register select will be high
because I'm writing data.

The next character ends the same but has 0101
at the beginning.

And the next character ends the same but has
0110 at the beginning.

For the confused face let's add a question
mark, this will have 0011 at the beginning.

Oh.

So what just happened there?

In order to fix this, what's actually happening
is that we're getting a bounce on the enable
line and the display will trigger every time
the enable goes from low to high but because
this button isn't perfect, sometimes when
i press down I'll get more than one click,
like that.

So a simple way to fix this would be to add
a capacitor and a couple resistors.

Okay that's much better now.

While i was playing with the enable line a
whole bunch of other characters came through.

Now what happens when the button is closed:
the five volts is allowed to charge up this
capacitor so that the the level goes from
zero to five volts slowly and then when the
button is open the capacitor discharges through
these two resistors back to zero.

That should eliminate our bounce issue but
notice something that's funny going on here.

Our display is interlaced.

As I continued from the first line the next
characters came in the third line, and after
the third line it jumps back to the second
line.

In before i forget: let me connect an LED
back up to this so that I can see what's going
on.

There we go, perfect.

So let's look at this display and see if we
can figure out what's going on with the memory
addresses.

On the datasheet here when we're looking at
the way the memory addresses work for a 16
character by two-line display.

We can see that the addresses start at 00
and go through 0F. on the second line they
start at 40 and go through to 4F.

Our display here is 20 characters wide so
we have an extra four characters on here.

We can see that when the display is shifted
left what happens is that the address of what's
displayed on our display would move over to
the right, so the first position in the top
left corner becomes 01 and the first position
on the second line becomes 41.

When we're shifting to the right the display
goes to the left and the memory addresses
that appear in the first position and second
position are 27 hex and 67 hex respectively
and these refer to the all the memory addresses
that are available for the HD44780.

The way this maps to the lines that we have
is the first and second lines come first and
then the third and fourth lines come after
that but in memory,
they're arranged like this.

So scrolling left and right or shifting left
and right will move characters between the
first line and the third line and characters
between the second line and the fourth line
depending on which direction we're going,
and all of the memory addresses from 00 all
the way up to 27 are used so there's nothing
hidden there, everything is always displayed.

The same is true for all of the memory addresses
from 40 up to 67 hex so let's draw the rest
of those out and see see where that puts us.

So we should be able to use this to move to
any address that we'd like on the screen,
where the third and fourth rows are here and
the first and second rows are here.

We can set the cursor position by setting
the high bit,
and we're sending to the instruction register
so the high bit set and all zeros according
to this should put us on the top row in the
first character.

That worked.

If we want to go to the last character on
the first row and we should be going to 13.

That worked.

If I want to go to the last character on the
last row then this should be 4F.

Oh my mistake, I got confused, this is the
second row.

If I  want to go to the last character on the
second row it would be 53.

There we go.

If I want to go to the last character on the
last row it should be 67.

There we go, and if I want to go to the first
character on the last row it should be here
at 54.

Perfect.

I've been talking about shifting but let's
take a look at how this would actually work.

In the entry mode set command I can say that
every time I enter a character, instead of
moving the cursor or in addition to moving
the cursor I'd like the the screen to shift
in the opposite direction so let's start with
that.

First I'll move up into the middle of the
screen here,
and I'll type an H character,
and again, and again.

So we can see that as I'm typing
everything that's on the third line
is wrapping back up to the first line.

Everything is on the first line
is coming back down to the third line.

Everything that's on the second line is wrapping
back down to the fourth line and
everything on the fourth line
is wrapping back onto the second line.

This is a very quick way to update the whole
display if you'd like to move text over,
we just need to take care to clear out the
characters before we move them like this.

I'd like to reset the shifting.

We can use the return home command which resets
the shift and sets us back to position zero.

Now we can see the memory layout as it as
it was originally without any shifting applied.

Let's look at reading data from the display
module.

First we connect a switch to the read/write
pin.

When this pin is high we're asking the display
module to set D0 through D7 pins high or low.

Now this is a problem, because our dip switches
might be forcing one line high when the display
module is trying to force it low, and if that
happens we could have enough current running
through to damage the display module.

To prevent damage we can use the second pole
of the read/write switch to disconnect the
high lines from all the dip switches.

Of course this is one more opportunity to
add an LED so we can see the state of the
read/write pin.

Okay this is what we want.

When the read/write pin is high, which means
read, we don't want any of the dip switches
pushing any of the D0 through D7 lines high;
but when read/write is off, when we're in
write mode, the dip switches operate as normal.

Okay let's initialize the display module again.

This time I'll just use the underline cursor
instead of the underline and the blinking
cursor.

I'll use the control code 1 0 again to return
home.

Now if I enable read mode and press the enable
button then i should be able to read back
the data that I entered here.

That's the code for A, code for B, code for
C, code for D, E, F, and that's a blank space.

When we read from the instruction register
we can also get the address of the cursor
location as well as a busy signal.

So this is the address of the current cursor
location.

You notice that the location doesn't change
when we do that read.

The top bit of this will indicate whether
there's an operation currently in progress
and we're not able to send additional commands.

With this particular setup on a breadboard
it's going to be basically impossible to ever
activate the busy signal, but if you're controlling
this with a microcontroller it's going to
be very important to know that you're not
sending commands too quickly, especially for
commands that take longer such as the clear
screen.

Let's look at CGRAM next.

If i put in characters 0 through 7 I should
be able to display characters that i control
the bitmap for.

This is character zero, one, two, three, four,
five, six, and seven.

Next I use the command to set the CGRAM address
to move my cursor where I'm going to be writing

data into CGRAM instead of into the DDRAM.

Writing to the data register lets us set the
pixels for the CGRAM characters.

The low five bits are used to set one row
of pixels and there are eight rows of pixels
for each character.

Now that i have some space invaders let's
arrange them on the screen.

Now let's animate these with the display shift.

This is a way that we can shift the display
without adding a character to it.

With the instruction register set, 1 1000
 should shift to the right... or to the left.

1 1100 should shift to the right.

There we go.

Shift back.

With cursor shift I can shift the cursor without
needing to know the exact address of the character

that I'm moving to.

This will let me move one character to the
left or one character to the right.

Let's finish off our space invaders playfield
with some enemy projectiles, a score display
and a life counter.

Thank you for watching, I hope you enjoyed
this video.

I'll see you next time.
