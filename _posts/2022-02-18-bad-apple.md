This post covers how we interface a 32K EEPROM, a clock and an
address register to a 20 x 4 LCD character display module and use it to
play a video. We "decompress" the video by expanding our 8-bit
data stream to 9 bits for playback in hardware. There is no CPU or
microcontroller involved.

To test step 1 of the [homebrew cpu project](/cpu) we'll see
if we can play an actual video from the EEPROM to the LCD character
display module. Bad Apple is an ideal video for this purpose: it's
essentially monochrome and most of the video is recognizable even
at a very low resolution.

![Original Bad Apple](/images/original-apple.png)

The original Bad Apple video has 6569 frames at 30 fps for a running
time of 3m39s. We have 32768 bytes so we need to run
our clock at 150 Hz to fit the complete video in EEPROM.

This gives us about *5 bytes* of data per frame of video, or a
constant video bitrate of 1.2 kb/s.

## LCD display memory

The LCD character display module uses an HD44780 controller and
has 20 columns of characters and 4 rows of character cells.
Each character cell is a 5 x 8 grid of pixels with a single
pixel space in between.

The memory used to display characters is
split into two banks of 80 bytes each. The banks are interlaced so that
bank 1 (D00-D39) covers lines 1 and 3, and bank 2 (E00-E39) covers
lines 2 and 4.

Our video area includes addresses 00-07 and 20-27 in both banks.

Bad Apple has a 4:3 aspect ratio which maps nicely to the 40 x 32 total
pixels in our video area of 8 columns and 4 rows.

## Character ROM

<img src="/images/character-codes.svg" width="510" alt="character ROM">

The character ROM on the LCD display module includes a "space"
character with none of the pixels set and a solid block character
(`'\xff'`) with all pixels set. These can be used to quickly paint
the solid parts of the video area.

## CGRAM

Custom character patterns are made possible with CGRAM. We
have 8 CGRAM characters (CG0-CG7):

The pixel patterns are given by the low 5 bits stored at each CGRAM address.
CGRAM is contiguous but we number the addresses based on the
character and row. E.g. C10 is the first row of CG1, and follows immediately
after C07.

With only 8 CGRAM characters *at least* 75% of our video area character cells
need to be blank or a solid block. We'll have to be clever about prioritizing
use of CGRAM character cells to make it seem like the whole video area is a
bitmap.

## LCD commands

We interface with the LCD display module using 8 data pins (DB0-DB7)
and a register select (RS) pin.

<img src="/images/commands.svg" width="650" alt="LCD commands">

When RS is low we can set the
display memory (DDRAM) or CGRAM address, clear the screen or issue
other cursor and display commands.
When RS is high we can write character data
to display memory (DDRAM) or send pixel data into CGRAM.

This code table can be expanded into a grid like the character ROM grid above:

<img src="/images/command-grid.svg" width="510" alt="LCD command grid">

We can see there are some unused values, like most of the function set
range and part of the set DDRAM address range. There are also some commands
with duplicate values like cursor or display shift commands and return home.

## Command compression

The EEPROM can only output 8 bits at a time but we need 9 bits including
RS to fully control the LCD display module.

If we add a 256-byte lookup table for RS then
we can combine sending character codes and LCD commands into 8 bits.
Also if we reassign the upper 4 bits (DB4-DB7) we can assign new positions
for commands in the table.

This is how the lookup table is wired to RS and the upper 4 bits (DB4-DB7):

In the table reassigning the upper 4 bits is the same as moving a command left or
right. This lets us fill in unused values or repeated commands, move the set
CGRAM address and function set commands out of the way, and replace unneeded
commands.

## Command lookup table

This is the combined lookup table that we use to map 8 input bits from
the EEPROM to 9 output bits for the LCD display module:

<img src="/images/hexmap.svg" width="510" alt="LCD command mapping">

[lookup_table.py](https://github.com/wardi/cpu/blob/main/bad-apple/lookup_table.py)
is the Python version of the same table:

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># byte order from top-&gt;bottom, left-&gt;right
# (mnemonic:)hex-value
</span><span class="n">hex_map</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">"""
C00:04 C20:05 12 13 14 15 16 17 D00:08 D16:09 D32:0a C40:06 E00:0c E16:0d E32:0e C60:07
<span class="c1">CLR:00</span> C21:05 12 13 14 15 16 17 D01:08 D17:09 C01:04 C41:06 E01:0c E17:0d E33:0e C61:07
HOM:00 C22:05 12 13 <span class="c1">14</span> 15 16 17 D02:08 D18:09 C02:04 C42:06 E02:0c E18:0d E34:0e C62:07

...
</span></code></pre></div></div>

The optional mnemonic labels a position and the hex value is the
value stored at that position in the table. The low 4 bits of the hex value are
connected to the high data lines of the HD44780 controller and the next bit is connected
to the RS line.

Let's look at two examples:

The second position on the left "`CLR:00`" is offset `0x01` in order from top to bottom:
- has a mnemonic of `CLR`
- has a hex value of `0x00` which means "set RS to 0 and D4-D7 to `0b0000`"
- D0-D3 are copied from the low bits of the offset value `0b0001`
- sending this command will clear the screen and reset the cursor position
  on the LCD display

The third position in the fifth column "`14`" is offset `0x42` in order from top to bottom:
- has no mnemonic but corresponds to ASCII character "`B`"
- has a hex value of `0x14` which means "set RS to 1 and D4-D7 to `0b0100`"
- D0-D3 are copied from the low bits of the offset value `0b0010`
- sending this command will output a "`B`" character and advance the cursor
  on the LCD display

All mnemonic offset values are exported from this table as simple variables in a
Python module
[baconsts.py](https://github.com/wardi/cpu/blob/main/bad-apple/baconsts.py):

```python
C00 = b"\x00"
CLR = b"\x01"
HOM = b"\x02"
CRT = b"\x03"
...
```

This mapping allows issuing one command per clock cycle from our EEPROM to our
LCD display module including:

- addressing all CGRAM
- addressing most of display memory (all of the video area)
- output ASCII(ish) characters and the solid block character `'\xff'`
- output CGRAM characters (CG0-CG7)
- initialize the display with function set (`INI`)
- set the entry mode to "increment, no shifting" (`EIN`)
- clear the screen (`CLR`)
- hide the cursor (`HID`)

These are all we need to play our video and show text on the right
side of the display.

üëç Thank you for reading this far. We covered the interface between
our EEPROM and LCD character display module, and how we perform hardware
decompression on the data stream.

In the next post we'll explore the
software that encodes video onto the 32K EEPROM using these commands.
