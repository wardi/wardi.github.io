The <a href="https://www.meetup.com/ottawapython/">Ottawa Python</a>
meetup group had its first hybrid meeting last week.
Our host <a href="https://www.spiria.com/">Spiria</a> recorded the
presentation and I've posted a slightly edited version above.

Thank you to Ivan at Spiria for hosting, Ian and Bryan from WiseWithData for
presenting and feeding us, and to everyone who came out. It was a great evening.
