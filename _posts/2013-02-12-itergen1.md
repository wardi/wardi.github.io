This is part one of a talk I gave January 24, 2013 at the Ottawa Python Authors Group

[Part Two](/article/2013/02/itergen2/) is now also available.

Both parts of this presentation are also available as a [single IPython Notebook](http://raw.github.com/wardi/iterables-iterators-generators/master/Iterables%2C%2520Iterators%2C%2520Generators.ipynb) which you can download and run locally, or view with [nbviewer.ipython.org](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/wardi/iterables-iterators-generators/master/Iterables%2C%2520Iterators%2C%2520Generators.ipynb).

# [A Gentle Introduction](#a-gentle-introduction)

The first few examples are from Ned Bachelder's Python Iteration Talk [http://bit.ly/pyiter](https://web.archive.org/web/20200214172926/http://bit.ly/pyiter)

Coming from another language you might find it natural to create a counter and increment it to iterate over a `list` in Python



```python
my_list = [17, 23, 47, 51, 101, 173, 999, 1001]

i = 0
while i < len(my_list):
    v = my_list[i]
    print(v)
    i += 1
```



```
17
23
47
51
101
173
999
1001
```

You might also have been told about `range()` which almost lets you write a C-style for loop



```python
for i in range(len(my_list)):
    v = my_list[i]
    print(v)
```



```
17
23
47
51
101
173
999
1001
```

But neither of the above are natural ways of iterating in python. We do this instead:



```python
for v in my_list:
    print(v)
```



```
17
23
47
51
101
173
999
1001
```

Many types of objects may be iterated over this way. Iterating over strings produces single characters:



```python
for v in "Hello":
    print(v)
```



```
H
e
l
l
o
```

Iterating over a `dict` produces its keys (in no particular order):



```python
d = {
    'a': 1,
    'b': 2,
    'c': 3,
    }

for v in d:
    print(v)
# Note the strange order!
```



```
a
c
b
```

Iterating over a file object produces lines from that file, including the line termination:



```python
f = open("suzuki.txt")
for line in f:
    print(">", line)
```

> "Education has failed in a very serious way to convey the most important lesson science can teach: skepticism."

> "An educational system isn't worth a great deal if it teaches young people how to make a living but doesn't teach them how to make a life."
```

Objects that can be iterated over in python are called "Iterables", and a for loop isn't the only thing that accepts iterables.

The list constructor takes any iterable. We can use this to make a list of the keys in a `dict`:



```python
list(d)
```



```
['a', 'c', 'b']
```

Or the characters in a string:



```python
list("Hello")
```



```
['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']
```

List comprehensions take iterables.



```python
ascii = [ord(x) for x in "Hello"]
ascii
```



```
[72, 101, 108, 108, 111]
```

The `sum()` function takes any iterable that produces numbers.



```python
sum(ascii)
```



```
500
```

The `str.join()` method takes any iterable that produces strings.



```python
"-".join(d)
```



```
'a-c-b'
```

Iterables can produce any python object. The `re.finditer()` function returns an iterable that produces `re.match` objects.



```python
import re
suzuki = open("suzuki.txt").read()
for match in re.finditer(r'\bs\w+', suzuki):
    print(match.group(0))
```

<span id="a-classic-iterable-class"></span>

# [A "classic" iterable class](#a-classic-iterable-class)

Very old versions of Python supported iteration through the `__getitem__()` method, and this is still supported.



```python
class Lucky(object):
    def __getitem__(self, index):
        if index > 3:
            raise IndexError
        return 7
```



`Lucky` is a class that will return `7` for any index less than or equal to `3`:



```python
lucky = Lucky()

lucky[0]
```



```
7
```

And raise an `IndexError` for larger indexes:



```python
lucky[6]
```



```
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
IndexError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
/home/ian/git/iterables-iterators-generators/<ipython-input-15-5c0a87559915> in <module>()
----> 1 lucky[6]

/home/ian/git/iterables-iterators-generators/<ipython-input-13-bd578dbfbead> in __getitem__(self, index)
      2     def __getitem__(self, index):
      3         if index > 3:
----> 4             raise IndexError
      5         return 7

IndexError:
```

This is a perfectly well-behaved python iterable. We can loop over it:



```python
for number in lucky:
    print(number)
```



```
7
7
7
7
```

Or pass it to functions that take iterables:



```python
list(lucky)
```



```
[7, 7, 7, 7]
```

Even the `in` operator works with it:



```python
7 in lucky
```



```
True
```

But writing this sort of class it difficult. You need to be able to return a value for any index passed to `__getitem__()` but most of the time you really only want to produce items in order from first to last.

Enter "Iterators".



<span id="iterators"></span>

# [Iterators](#iterators)

The naming is confusingly similar here, but it's important to understand the difference between _iterables_ and _iterators_.

Iterators are iterables with some kind of 'position' state and a `next()` method. The `next()` method may be called to produce the next item and update the internal state.

Iterables are objects that produce an iterator when they are passed to the `iter()` builtin.

![Iterators are Iterables with next()](/images/iterable_iterator.png)

Calling `iter()` on our "classic" iterable object produces a plain `iterator` instance



```python
i = iter(lucky)
i
```



```
<iterator at 0x288cc10>
```

This plain `iterator` has a counter and the original object as its internal state. Calling `next()` advances the counter and calls our "classic" iterable's `.__getitem__()` method.



```python
print(next(i))
print(next(i))
print(next(i))
print(next(i))
```



```
7
7
7
7
```

When we get to the end however, our `IndexError` exception is turned into a `StopIteration` exception. This is the iterator protocol: when `next()` raises `StopIteration` there are no more items to be produced.



```python
print(next(i)) # raises StopIteration, *not* IndexError
```



```
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
StopIteration                             Traceback (most recent call last)
/home/ian/git/iterables-iterators-generators/<ipython-input-21-b3e04e043095> in <module>()
----> 1 print(next(i)) # raises StopIteration, *not* IndexError

StopIteration:
```

Remember that an iterator _is_ an iterable, so it can be passed to anything that takes an iterable.

Be careful, though. Iterators may only be iterated over once, since they are updating their internal state as they go. If we try to iterate twice, the second time will produce no more items:



```python
i = iter(lucky)
print(list(i))
print(list(i))
```



```
[7, 7, 7, 7]
[]
```

Calling on `iter()` on an iterable will produce a different iterator object each time.



```python
i is iter(lucky)
```



```
False
```

Also, like other iterables, calling `iter()` on an iterator works, but it behaves differently!

Calling `iter()` on an iterator typically returns the exact same iterator. If you think about it, that's all that can be done because you can't rewind or duplicate an iterator in the general case.



```python
i is iter(i)
```



```
True
```

Iterators come in all shapes and sizes.

`xrange()` has a `rangeiterator`:



```python
iter(xrange(20))
```



```
<rangeiterator at 0x2896900>
```

`dict` has a `dictionary-keyiterator`:



```python
iter({'a': 1, 'b': 2})
```



```
<dictionary-keyiterator at 0x2894aa0>
```

`list` doesn't even use the plain `iterator` type, and instead uses its own more efficient `listiterator`:



```python
iter([4, 5, 6])
```



```
<listiterator at 0x28973d0>
```

And some have names that provide no clue what they iterate over:



```python
re.finditer(r'\bs\w+', "some text with swords")
```



```
<callable-iterator at 0x28971d0>
```



<span id="a-better-iterable-class"></span>

# [A better iterable class](#a-better-iterable-class)

You can choose the iterator that will be returned by `iter()` by defining your own `.__iter__()` method:



```python
class Countdown(object):
    def __iter__(self): # must return an iterator!
        return iter([5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 'launch'])
```



The `for` loop and other places that take iterables internally use `iter()`, which calls our new `.__iter__()` method to create an iterator:



```python
for n in Countdown():
    print(n)
```



```
5
4
3
2
1
launch
```



<span id="iterators-the-hard-way"></span>

# [Iterators the hard way](#iterators-the-hard-way)

The example above is fine if we want to reuse an existing iterator (like the `listiterator` above), but what if we want to write a new iterator?

We know the protocol, so one approach is to just implement it:



```python
class CountdownIterator(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self._remaining = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 'launch']

    def __iter__(self):
        return self

    def __next__(self):
        if not self._remaining:
            raise StopIteration
        return self._remaining.pop(0)
```



Our internal 'position' state is a list of items we pop one at a time when `.next()` is called. We implement `.__iter__()` in the normal way for an iterator: `"return self"`. We raise `StopIteration` when we have nothing left to produce.

This works as expected, but it's rather a lot of code for a simple result.



```python
for n in CountdownIterator():
    print(n)
```



```
5
4
3
2
1
launch
```



<span id="generators"></span>

# [Generators](#generators)

A generator function is a simpler way to create an iterator.

Generator functions let you use local variables and the position of the program counter as state for a generator object. A new generator object is created and returned each time you call a generator function. The generator object is an iterator.

![Generators are Iterators created with a generator function or expression](/images/iterable_iterator_generator.png)

Here is a generator function that _only_ uses the program counter for state:



```python
def countdown_generator():
    yield 5
    yield 4
    yield 3
    yield 2
    yield 1
    yield 'launch'
```



When we call the generator function it does nothing except create a new generator object. None of the code in the generator function has been executed yet.



```python
countdown_generator()
```



```
<generator object countdown_generator at 0x289d0f0>
```

As the generator object is iterated over execution starts, following the generator function definition until the next `yield` statement.

When it reaches the `yield` statement execution is paused (the program counter is stored) and the value on the right of the `yield` statement is produced as a value from the generator object. Execution is resumed from the stored program counter position when iteration continues.

When the generator function reaches the end, the generator raises a `StopIteration` exception just like a normal iterator. And it behaves just like a normal iterator:



```python
for n in countdown_generator():
    print(n)
```



```
5
4
3
2
1
launch
```

Now we have a much more concise way of defining our own iterator for an iterable class. The `.__iter__()` method of our class can be written as a generator function:



```python
class Countdown(object):
    def __iter__(self):
        for n in [5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 'launch']:
            yield n
```





```python
for n in Countdown():
    print(n)
```



```
5
4
3
2
1
launch
```

But, enough about classes. Let's dig further into how these generators work.

Recall that execution of the code in a generator function does not proceed until the generator object returned is iterated over. That lets us put things in a generator that might be expensive, knowing that we will only have to pay that cost when we actually ask it to produce the next item.

This generator causes a for loop to slow down between iterations. First waiting 5 seconds, then counting down from "5" to "1" with 1 seconds intervals in between:



```python
import time

def slow_generator():
    time.sleep(5)
    yield 5
    time.sleep(1)
    yield 4
    time.sleep(1)
    yield 3
    time.sleep(1)
    yield 2
    time.sleep(1)
    yield 1
    time.sleep(1)

print("starting")
for n in slow_generator():
    print n
print("done")
```



```
starting
5
4
3
2
1
done
```

Another way of writing this code is to turn the generator inside-out.

Instead of sleeping inside the generator we can `yield` the amount of time we want to sleep. And instead of `yield`-ing the countdown we can use a function passed in to display values to the user.



```python
def countdown_generator(fn):
    yield 5
    fn(5)
    yield 1
    fn(4)
    yield 1
    fn(3)
    yield 1
    fn(2)
    yield 1
    fn(1)
    yield 1
```



A `show()` function takes the place of the print inside the loop, and the `time.sleep()` call is done by the code iterating over the generator. This puts the code driving the generator in charge of how (or if) it sleeps for the given time.



```python
def show(n):
    print(n)

print("starting")
for s in countdown_generator(show):
    time.sleep(s)
print("done")
```



```
starting
5
4
3
2
1
done
```



<span id="generators-as-coroutines"></span>

# [Generators as coroutines](#generators-as-coroutines)

While a generator object is an iterator, it can also be used for much more.

When paused at a `yield` statement generator objects can receive data by using `.send()` instead of `next()`.

When we use `yield` as an expression or assign it to a variable, the value passed to `.send()` is available inside the generator.



```python
def knock_knock():
    name = yield "Who's there?"
    yield "%s who?" % name
    yield "That's not funny at all"
```



We have to switch to manually calling `next()` on our generator object, because a `for` loop or function that takes an iterable won't be able to call `.send()` when we need to.



```python
k = knock_knock()
next(k)
```



```
"Who's there?"
```

At this point execution is paused at the first `yield`. The assignment to the variable `name` hasn't happened yet. But when we `.send()` a value execution continues:



```python
k.send("David")
```



```
'David who?'
```

And in the generator object we are at the second `yield` with `"David"` assigned to `name`.

If we send something to a `yield` that isn't being used as an expression, the value we send will be ignored:



```python
k.send("David the environmentalist")
```



```
"That's not funny at all"
```

But execution continues the same as if we called `next()`.

This is the end of part 1.

In [part 2](https://web.archive.org/web/20200214172926/http://excess.org/article/2013/02/itergen2/) we build a simple interactive network game with 90% of the code written as generators. I will show how breaking down asynchronous code into generators can make it easy to test, easy to reuse, and (with some practice) easy to understand.
