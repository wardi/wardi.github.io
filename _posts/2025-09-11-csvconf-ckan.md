In September <a href="https://amercader.net/">Adrià Mercader</a> and I hosted a CKAN workshop as part of
<a href="https://csvconf.com/">csv,conf,v9</a> in Bologna, Italy.

This was the third in-person CKAN event I've been lucky enough to help organize. I'm grateful to the
<a href="https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/pathways-enable-open-source-ecosystems-pose">POSE project</a>
and <a href="https://linkdigital.com.au/">Link Digital</a>
for supporting this event, and I'm looking forward to many more like this one.
