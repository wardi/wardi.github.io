After working on [PyRF](https://pyrf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) this past year, I was asked to help edit to a paper written by [ThinkRF](https://thinkrf.com/)'s Nikhil Adnani for AUTOTESTCON 2013: [Wideband 20 GHz RF Digitizer and Python-based Open Application Framework for Test and Measurement](https://excess.org/media/file/2013/10/ThinkRF_Autotestcon_paper.pdf).

This paper won the Walter E. Peterson award for Best Paper on Technology.
