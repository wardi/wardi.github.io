![XTerm 256-Colour Chart (cows)](/images/colour_chart_sm.png)

Announcing XTerm Colour Chart 2.0 “Old and busted: Colour Cubes. New hotness: Colour Cows” release.

The script has been completely rewritten. It now requires python 2.3 or later for the optparse command-line parsing module.

Many new features have been added to this version:

 - Five different charts available in 256 and 88-colour modes
 - Origin and rotation of colour cube is now configurable
 - Size of colour cells is now configurable
 - Colour palette now exactly matches xterm defaults
 - Resetting colour palette is now flicker-free
 - Source code is much nicer (and commented!)
