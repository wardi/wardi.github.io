![data.gc.ca](/media/image/2013/06/data_gc_ga.png "data.gc.ca")

A site I've been working on for the past few months has just launched. [data.gc.ca "2.0" (update: now open.canada.ca)](https://open.canada.ca/) is a completely rewritten version of the Open Data portal for the Government of Canada.

I worked on the [CKAN](https://ckan.org/) portion of the site responsible for the data catalogue. CKAN is an open source Data Portal application written in Python. I built a fully bilingual schema with many additional fields for our datasets. I also optimized, fixed and improved many parts of CKAN itself.

Our team built templates based on the [Web Experience Toolkit (WET)](https://github.com/wet-boew/wet-boew). 
WET provides building blocks for creating accessible, mobile-friendly web sites.
 These templates include a [map widget for our geospatial datasets](https://wet-boew.github.io/wet-boew-legacy/v3.1/demos/geomap/geomap-en.html) and an [interactive data table](https://wet-boew.github.io/v4.0-ci/demos/tables/tables-en.html) for previews of tabular data.

All of our work is available on the [open-data github page](https://github.com/open-data/) and is released under a permissive license.

data.gc.ca might just be the largest, most fully bilingual and most accessible CKAN site anywhere. More to come!
